# 🏁 Formula 1 Drivers in Wikidata: Enrichment with LLMs

Welcome to our KE4H project, where we explore the world of Formula 1 drivers through the lens of the Wikidata Knowledge Graph.

Although Wikidata is one of the most comprehensive open knowledge bases, we discovered that many facts about even the most prominent F1 drivers are missing, outdated, or incomplete. From recent championship wins to team transfers and personal background details, key pieces of structured information were often absent.

To address these semantic gaps, we employed Large Language Models (LLMs) — including ChatGPT and Gemini — to retrieve and generate missing knowledge. We asked the models to produce RDF triples using the Wikidata ontology, and then manually verified and corrected the outputs to ensure precision and consistency.

> This project demonstrates how **SPARQL queries**, **AI-generated content**, and **human validation**  
> can work together to improve the quality of open linked data — **one triple at a time.**
